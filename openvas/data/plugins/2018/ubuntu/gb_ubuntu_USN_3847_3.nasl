LTS. This update provides the corresponding updates for the Linux
kernel for Microsoft Azure Cloud systems for Ubuntu 14.04 LTS.

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the raw MIDI driver for
the Linux kernel, leading to a double free vulnerability. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-10902)

It was discovered that an integer overrun vulnerability existed in the
POSIX timers implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2018-12896)

Noam Rathaus discovered that a use-after-free vulnerability existed in the
Infiniband implementation in the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2018-14734)

It was discovered that the YUREX USB device driver for the Linux kernel did
not properly restrict user space reads or writes. A physically proximate
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or
possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-16276)

It was discovered that the BPF verifier in the Linux kernel did not
correctly compute numeric bounds in some situations. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2018-18445)

Kanda Motohiro discovered that writing extended attributes to an XFS file
system in the Linux kernel in certain situations could cause an error
condition to occur. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service. (CVE-2018-18690)

It was discovered that an integer overflow vulnerability existed in the
CDROM driver of the Linux kernel. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2018-18710)");
