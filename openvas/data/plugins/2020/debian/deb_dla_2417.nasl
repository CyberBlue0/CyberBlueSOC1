CVE-2020-12351

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation in the way L2CAP packets with A2MP CID are handled. A remote attacker in short distance knowing the victim's Bluetooth device address can send a malicious l2cap packet and cause a denial of service or possibly arbitrary code execution with kernel privileges.

CVE-2020-12352

Andy Nguyen discovered a flaw in the Bluetooth implementation. Stack memory is not properly initialised when handling certain AMP packets. A remote attacker in short distance knowing the victim's Bluetooth device address address can retrieve kernel stack information.

CVE-2020-25211

A flaw was discovered in netfilter subsystem. A local attacker able to inject conntrack Netlink configuration can cause a denial of service.

CVE-2020-25643

ChenNan Of Chaitin Security Research Lab discovered a flaw in the hdlc_ppp module. Improper input validation in the ppp_cp_parse_cr() function may lead to memory corruption and information disclosure.

CVE-2020-25645

A flaw was discovered in the interface driver for GENEVE encapsulated traffic when combined with IPsec. If IPsec is configured to encrypt traffic for the specific UDP port used by the GENEVE tunnel, tunneled data isn't correctly routed over the encrypted link and sent unencrypted instead.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version 4.19.152-1~deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux-4.19 packages.

For the detailed security status of linux-4.19 please refer to its security tracker page at: [link moved to references]
