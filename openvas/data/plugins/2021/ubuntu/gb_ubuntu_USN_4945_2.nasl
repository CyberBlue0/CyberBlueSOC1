Original advisory details:

It was discovered that the Nouveau GPU driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly handle error conditions in some situations. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25639)

Jan Beulich discovered that the Xen netback backend in the Linux kernel did
not properly handle certain error conditions under paravirtualization. An
attacker in a guest VM could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(host domain crash). (CVE-2021-28038)

It was discovered that the fastrpc driver in the Linux kernel did not
prevent user space applications from sending kernel RPC messages. A local
attacker could possibly use this to gain elevated privileges.
(CVE-2021-28375)

It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8188EU Wireless device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly validate ssid lengths in some situations. An
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2021-28660)

It was discovered that the USB/IP driver in the Linux kernel contained race
conditions during the update of local and shared status. An attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29265)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the netfilter subsystem
of the Linux kernel when replacing tables. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2021-29650)

Arnd Bergmann discovered that the video4linux subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not properly deallocate memory in some situations. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (memory exhaustion).
(CVE-2021-30002)");
