Linux kernel contained a reference counting error. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2020-25670)

Kiyin (Yin Liang ) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly deallocate memory in certain error
situations. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(memory exhaustion). (CVE-2020-25671, CVE-2020-25672)

Kiyin (Yin Liang ) discovered that the NFC LLCP protocol implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle error conditions in some situations,
leading to an infinite loop. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service. (CVE-2020-25673)

It was discovered that the Realtek RTL8188EU Wireless device driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly validate ssid lengths in some situations. An
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2021-28660)

Zygo Blaxell discovered that the btrfs file system implementation in the
Linux kernel contained a race condition during certain cloning operations.
A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2021-28964)

Vince Weaver discovered that the perf subsystem in the Linux kernel did not
properly handle certain PEBS records properly for some Intel Haswell
processors. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2021-28971)

It was discovered that the RPA PCI Hotplug driver implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly handle device name writes via sysfs, leading
to a buffer overflow. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.
(CVE-2021-28972)

It was discovered that the Qualcomm IPC router implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize memory passed to user space. A local
attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory).
(CVE-2021-29647)

Dan Carpenter discovered that the block device manager (dm) implementation
in the Linux kernel contained a buffer overflow in the ioctl for listing
devices. A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash). (CVE-2021-31916)

It was discovered that the CIPSO implementation in the Linux kernel did not
properly perform reference counting in some situations, leading to use-
after-free vulnerabilities. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33033)

Wolfgang Frisch discovered that the ext4 file system implementation in the
Linux kernel contained an integer overflow when handling metadata inode
extents. An attacker could use this to construct a malicious ext4 file
system image that, when mounted, could cause a denial of service (system
crash). ... [Please see the references for more information on the vulnerabilities]");
