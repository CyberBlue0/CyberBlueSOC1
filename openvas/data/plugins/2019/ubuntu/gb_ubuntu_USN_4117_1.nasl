Wireless LAN device driver for the Linux kernel. An attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2019-10126)

Amit Klein and Benny Pinkas discovered that the Linux kernel did not
sufficiently randomize IP ID values generated for connectionless networking
protocols. A remote attacker could use this to track particular Linux
devices. (CVE-2019-10638)

It was discovered that a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability existed in
the Near-field communication (NFC) implementation in the Linux kernel. A
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2019-12984)

Jann Horn discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in the Linux kernel
when accessing LDT entries in some situations. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute
arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-13233)

Jann Horn discovered that the ptrace implementation in the Linux kernel did
not properly record credentials in some situations. A local attacker could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly gain
administrative privileges. (CVE-2019-13272)

It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly validate meta data, leading to a buffer overread. A local attacker
could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2019-14283)

It was discovered that the floppy driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly validate ioctl() calls, leading to a division-by-zero. A local
attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash).
(CVE-2019-14284)

It was discovered that the Marvell Wireless LAN device driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly validate the BSS descriptor. A local attacker could
possibly use this to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2019-3846)

Jason Wang discovered that an infinite loop vulnerability existed in the
virtio net driver in the Linux kernel. A local attacker in a guest VM could
possibly use this to cause a denial of service in the host system.
